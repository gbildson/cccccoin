# CCCCcoin Integration/Staging Tree


## What is CCCCCoin?
CCCCcoin is an experimental implementation of some ideas that I have been playing with.  It is based directly off of an older Dogecoin codebase so you should see a fair number of such references.   

Congratulations if you've made it this far.   The only interesting pieces of this code are the changes to the proof of work in main.h/main.cpp, the use and addition of multiple hashes, the configuration of rewards for devs and the setup for specific hashing by miners.  

This code is a work in progress.  My intention was to rebase it off of the latest codebase and carry on with varipous experiments.  As such, even the changes are a little rough around the edges.
